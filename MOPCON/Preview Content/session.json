technologies such as defi and NFT are widely known to the public, the economic model of earning while playing is gradually emerging. By developing games on the blockchain, the characters and props in the game are sold in the form of NFT. In addition, the cryptocurrencies and NFT assets earned in the game can be traded on the blockchain, allowing GameFi players to earn money while playing, realizing the Play-to-Earn business model. Different game rules can be created through smart contracts. Since smart contracts are open and cannot be tampered with, the game experience is relatively fair, realizing the concept of Game+NFT+DeFi.","is_keynote":false,"is_online":false,"recordable":true,"level":"Normal ","target":"\u5c0d\u5340\u584a\u93c8\u548c GameFi \u6709\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u60f3\u8981\u958b\u767c Dapp \u7b49\u61c9\u7528\u7684\u6703\u773e\u3002","target_e":"The person who is interesting in Blockchain and GameFi, and want to build a Dapp.","prior_knowledge":"\u5340\u584a\u93c8\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8b58\u3001solidity \u57fa\u672c\u8a9e\u6cd5","prior_knowledge_e":"Blockchain basic knowledge, solidity Language","expected_gain":"\u4e86\u89e3 GameFi \u7684\u61c9\u7528\u548c\u50f9\u503c\uff0c\u5c0d\u5340\u584a\u93c8 Dapp \u958b\u767c\u7522\u751f\u6fc3\u539a\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u958b\u767c\u51fa\u8a31\u591a\u5340\u584a\u93c8\u904a\u6232\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u3002","expected_gain_e":"Understand the application and value of GameFi, have a strong interest in blockchain Dapp development, and then develop many blockchain game applications.","started_at":1665798900,"ended_at":1665801600,"tags":[{"color":{"web":"#51A3D3","mobile":"#51A3D3"},"name":"Web3"},{"color":{"web":"#51A3D3","mobile":"#51A3D3"},"name":"Mobile App"}],"speakers":[{"speaker_id":202,"name":"York Chang","name_e":"York Chang","job_title":"\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b","job_title_e":"Engineer","company":"","company_e":"","img":{"web":"api\/2022\/speaker\/images\/speaker_202","mobile":"api\/2022\/speaker\/images\/speaker_202"},"link_github":"","link_twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/YorkChang01","link_other":"https:\/\/yorkisinhere.medium.com\/","link_fb":""}],"sponsor_id":0,"community_partner":""},{"session_id":2022008,"room":"R4","floor":"3F","topic":"\u8d8a\u6c92\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u8d8a\u8981\u5beb\u55ae\u5143\u6e2c\u8a66 - \u55ae\u5143\u6e2c\u8a66\u5982\u4f55\u52a9\u6211\u6bcf\u5929\u6e96\u6642\u4e0b\u73ed\uff08\u4ee5 Java \u70ba\u4f8b\uff09","topic_e":"No time no test?

This made the speaker think about whether there is a way to use the \"self-adjusted learning\" strategy to collect records of students' computer use, and mark them with AI for students to evaluate and improve their computer use efficiency.\n\nTo this end, the speaker developed Focus, an application that uses Web API and Tensorflow.js to perform local operations on web pages to collect users' facial expressions and gaze trajectories, allowing users to record and play back their computer usage process and reflect on improvements accordingly. .
